Different Lasers
----------------
Red             Standard laser - deals 1 damage
Magenta         fat laser - deals 2.8 damage - bigger ball
Green           small laser - deals 0.3 damage - bounces off asteroids 3 times

Laser Upgrades
--------------
The lasers are upgradeable. If you collect a laser powerup of the same
color you already have, your laser gets a level-up. Every laser has levels
from 1 up to 4. Discover the upgrades for yourself, or change the config to
cheat a bit ;)
